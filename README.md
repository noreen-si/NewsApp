# News-App
This is a news app that uses the [News Api](https://newsapi.org/).
Users can browse through top headlines across the U.S.

Lastly, they may sort news by category and search articles.

This news app uses the following:

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to assist in API calls.
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) which handles the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects 
* [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) to load and cache images by URL.
